# E3D bowden mount for prusa i2

This is a mount for the all metal E3D nozzle, bowden version, for the prusa i2. 
It features a 40mm fan vent, for proper cooling of the cold end.

This was designed back in the day where I had access to CATIA, and it was the only 
CAD program I could use.

The design ended up working quite good, and to this day I still use it.

FreeCAD migration of the files is to be expected.
